# Mobile Scroll Fix - Changelog

## Overview

Fixed critical bug where vertical page scrolling was completely blocked on mobile devices after adding price slider/filter UI.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Radix UI body scroll lock**: `body[data-scroll-locked]` was blocking scroll even when modals closed
2. **Incorrect touch-action**: Slider used `pan-y` instead of `pan-x`, blocking vertical scroll
3. **Sheet overlay interference**: Fixed overlay remained interactive when closed
4. **Missing scroll enforcement**: No safety mechanism to ensure scroll stays enabled

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/globals.css` ✅

**Changes:**

- Added critical scroll rules: `html, body, #__next { height: auto !important; min-height: 100%; overflow-y: auto !important; }`
- Added `.price-slider, .slider-wrapper { touch-action: pan-x; }` for proper slider behavior
- Fixed `body[data-scroll-locked]` override to force scroll enabled
- Added overlay state rules for closed modals

**Why:** Global CSS was the primary blocker - incorrect overflow and touch-action rules

### 2. `src/components/ScrollEnsurer.tsx` ✅ (NEW FILE)

**Changes:**

- Created client component with useEffect to force scroll enabled
- Added MutationObserver to watch for scroll-blocking changes
- Automatically restores scroll if any component tries to disable it

**Why:** Safety net to ensure scroll never gets permanently disabled

### 3. `src/app/layout.tsx` ✅

**Changes:**

- Added `<ScrollEnsurer />` component
- Added inline styles for html/body with proper scroll properties
- Kept metadata functionality intact

**Why:** Ensures scroll enforcement runs on every page load

### 4. `src/components/PriceFilter.tsx` ✅

**Changes:**

- Wrapped Slider in `.price-slider` and `.slider-wrapper` divs
- Added `style={{ touchAction: 'pan-x' }}` to wrapper
- Applied proper CSS classes for slider-specific touch behavior

**Why:** Slider needed horizontal-only touch action to not interfere with vertical scroll

### 5. `src/components/ui/slider.tsx` ✅

**Changes:**

- Changed `style={{ touchAction: "pan-y" }}` to `style={{ touchAction: "pan-x" }}`
- Removed conflicting touch-action that was blocking vertical scroll

**Why:** Slider should only handle horizontal drag, not block vertical scroll

### 6. `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` ✅

**Changes:**

- Added `data-[state=closed]:pointer-events-none data-[state=closed]:invisible` to overlay
- Ensures closed sheet overlay doesn't interfere with page scroll

**Why:** Fixed overlay was intercepting touch events even when modal closed

### 7. `tests/mobile-scroll.spec.ts` ✅ (NEW FILE)

**Changes:**

- Created comprehensive E2E tests for mobile scroll
- Tests homepage scroll, test page scroll, filter interactions
- Includes both mobile and desktop test scenarios

**Why:** Automated verification that mobile scroll works and doesn't regress

### 8. `playwright.config.ts` ✅ (NEW FILE)

**Changes:**

- Added Playwright configuration for mobile testing
- Configured iPhone 12, Pixel 5, and Desktop Chrome projects
- Set up dev server integration

**Why:** Enables running automated mobile scroll tests

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken):

```css
/* Blocked scroll */
body[data-scroll-locked] {
  overflow: hidden;
}
.slider {
  touch-action: pan-y;
} /* Blocked vertical scroll */
.overlay {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
} /* Always intercepted touches */
```

### After (Fixed):

```css
/* Force scroll enabled */
html,
body,
#__next {
  overflow-y: auto !important;
  touch-action: pan-y;
}
body[data-scroll-locked] {
  overflow: auto !important;
}
.price-slider {
  touch-action: pan-x;
} /* Allow horizontal drag only */
.overlay[data-state="closed"] {
  pointer-events: none;
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing:

- ✅ Homepage scrolls on mobile
- ✅ Test page (`/test-scroll`) scrolls properly
- ✅ Filter interactions don't break scroll
- ✅ Slider still works for price adjustments
- ✅ Desktop functionality unchanged

### Automated Testing:

```bash
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright test tests/mobile-scroll.spec.ts
```

## Verification Steps

1. Open site on mobile device or mobile emulator
2. Try to scroll vertically on homepage - should work smoothly
3. Open filters, interact with price slider, close filters
4. Verify page still scrolls after filter interaction
5. Test on `/test-scroll` page for basic scroll functionality

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are additive or fix broken behavior.

## Performance Impact

Minimal - added one lightweight client component and CSS rules.

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ iOS Safari
- ✅ Android Chrome
- ✅ Desktop browsers (unchanged)
