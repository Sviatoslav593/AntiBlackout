# LiqPay Cart Clearing & Email Notifications Fix

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: After successful online payment, cart was not cleared and email notifications were not sent.

## 🔧 Root Cause

The problem was in the payment flow:
1. **Order creation** happened only in the callback (server-side)
2. **Frontend** had no way to know about successful payment
3. **Cart clearing** and **email notifications** were not triggered
4. **Order data** was not available on success page

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Pending Orders Storage**
- Created `pending_orders` table in Supabase
- Store order data during payment preparation
- Retrieve data in callback for order creation

### 2. **Order Success API Endpoint**
- New `/api/order-success` endpoint
- Fetches order data by orderId
- Returns complete order information

### 3. **Enhanced Order Success Page**
- Detects `orderId` parameter from LiqPay redirect
- Fetches order data from API
- Automatically clears cart after successful order
- Shows loading state during data fetch

### 4. **Improved Payment Callback**
- Retrieves stored order data from `pending_orders`
- Creates order with complete customer and item data
- Sends email notifications after order creation
- Cleans up pending order data

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **Online Payment Flow:**
```
1. User selects "Оплата карткою онлайн"
2. Clicks "Оформити замовлення"
3. Order data stored in pending_orders table
4. LiqPay form shown with payment data
5. User completes payment on LiqPay
6. LiqPay redirects to /order-success?orderId=XXX
7. Order success page fetches data from API
8. Cart automatically cleared
9. Order created in Supabase with full data
10. Email notifications sent
11. Success page shows complete order details
```

### **Cash on Delivery Flow:**
```
1. User selects "Післяплата"
2. Clicks "Оформити замовлення"
3. Order created immediately in Supabase
4. Cart cleared immediately
5. Email notifications sent
6. Redirect to success page with order data
```

## 📊 Database Changes

### **New Table: pending_orders**
```sql
CREATE TABLE pending_orders (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  items JSONB NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
